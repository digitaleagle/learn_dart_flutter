Create an array of random numbers.  Next, sort them.

Make a constant that will be the length of the array.  Loop that number of times and add a
random number to the array each time.

Print the array before sorting it so we can see the unsorted version.  Then, choose a method to sort
the array and print the array sorted lowest to highest.

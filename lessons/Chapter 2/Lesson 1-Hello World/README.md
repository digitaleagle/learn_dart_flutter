## main() function

Every dart program needs a main() function.  This tells the program where to start.  It looks like
this:

```dart
    main() {
      // your code goes here  
    }     
```

Here's a good article that explains it:
[Geeks for Geeks: Dart -- main() function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dart-main-function/#:~:text=Dart%20%E2%80%93%20main()%20Function&text=It%20is%20the%20most%20important,%2C%20and%20user%2Ddefined%20functions.)

## print command

The print command writes something out to the "console".  This is a great tool for debugging
and seeing what is going on in your program.

Here's a quick example:
```dart
    print("This is my message to the console");
```

This article has much more than printing, but it covers the print() command.  Pay attention to
the print command, and if you can't understand the rest that's okay at this point.

## Dart Pad

For this exercise, you don't even have to install Dart on your computer.  You can use Dart Pad
to write and run the program.

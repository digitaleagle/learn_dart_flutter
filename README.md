# Learn Programming Concepts with Dart and Flutter

Learn Programming Concepts with Dart and Flutter

## Rationale

Many tutorials and lessons exist for both Dart and Flutter, but all of them that I have seen assume 
that you already know how to program.  None of them introduce basic programming concepts using the 
Dart language.  I attempted to teach my son programming through a series of emails.  Then, we 
decided: "Why not share the lessons with the world?"  Here's the attempt.

## Where to start

To start through the lessons, view the lessons list in the lessons directory.  You can either 
start with Chapter 1 to install Dart, Flutter, and an IDE.  Or, you can start with Chapter 2 if 
you already have one installed.

- [Lessons Outline](lessons/README.md)
- Chapter 1 ... TBD
- [Chapter 2: Hello World](lessons/Chapter%202/Lesson%201-Hello%20World)

# Learn Programming Concepts with Dart and Flutter

Dart is an object oriented programming language, developed by Google in 2011. A programming language provides a way for you to organize instructions into a format that computers can understand and perform. Dart is easy to learn, and is very similar to C# and Java. Flutter is an SDK (software development kit) that lets you easily write apps for Android and iOS. Flutter is an "extension" to Dart that provides several widgets to design an app. This just means that Flutter has a library of buttons, icons, text boxes and more for you to use witn Dart.

This repository is designed to teach you programming concepts, and how to apply these programming concepts with Dart and Flutter to write your own programs. If you are a beginner to programming, this repository will teach you through Dart and Flutter, and set you on the right path to teaching yourself other languages and programming tools. If you are an experiences programmer, this repository will help you master the syntax and proper use of Dart and Flutter.

## Rationale

Many tutorials and lessons exist for both Dart and Flutter, but all of them that I have seen assume that you already know how to program.  None of them introduce basic programming concepts using the Dart language.  I attempted to teach my son programming through a series of emails.  Through the process, we realized that you don't need to buy expensive textbooks or take a complicated class at school to learn programming concepts with Dart and Flutter: there are many free, easy-to-use resources availabe, you just have to know where to find them. In this repository, I have organized a series of lessons that will teach you to effectively use dart and flutter. 

Each lesson will consist of the following:

  1)  Brief explanation of the programming concept being taught.
  2)  Two to Four tutorial websites for additional information and proper syntax.
  3)  Programming exercise to assess your understanding of the concept.

If you're just beginning programming, the explanations and online resources should be very helpful. Also, if you struggle with the exercise at the end of the lesson, don't worry: there will be an provided solution with detailed explanations. If you're an experience programmer who is new to Dart and Flutter, you might skip the explanations and look at the syntax and exercise for each lesson.

## Where to start

To start through the lessons, view the lessons list in the lessons folder.  If you are just starting programming, you may want to start with Chapter 1, which explains what Dart and Flutter are, how to install them, and how to set up an IDE (somewhere you can comfortably write your programs).  Alternatively, if you already have Dart, Flutter, and an IDE installed, you can start with Chapter 2, which begins the Dart tutorials.
